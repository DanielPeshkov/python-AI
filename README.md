# python-AI

This project is my work-in-progress implementation of a Deep Learning Framework in Python. Much of the code in the initial commit came from a book, Neural Networks From Scratch, By Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela. I am inspired by their work, and intend to build upon what I've learned from them and in the process come to a deeper understanding of the inner workings of machine learning algorithms.
